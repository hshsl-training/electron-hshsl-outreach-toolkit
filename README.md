# HSHSL Outreach Toolkit

#### Description
Tools and best-practices for outreach campaigns.

#### Purpose
Provide resources for HSHSL staff to best leverage available communication channels, including:
- UMB outlets (display boards, The Elm, school/administrative contacts)
- social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
- email newsletters (MailChimp)
- blog (WordPress)

## About this repo

This is the `master` branch readme; it provides an understanding of the workflow for this project.

The idea in this project is that all of the various parts of the toolkit are organized into separate development branches, including:
- `admin-contacts`
- `display-boards`
- `elm`
- `mailchimp`
- `master`
- `social-media`
- `wordpress`

When work in any given development branch is ready to ship it gets copied to `master`.

The expected deliverables for this project include:
- powerpoint starter slides customized for particular outlets
- documentation, best-practices, and tutorial text, likely as custom HTML or libguide (for WordPress, social media, etc.)
- custom HTML sandbox for previewing Elm submission content
- tabular data as HTML for presenting school/administrative contacts
- a generalized version of this toolkit to be made available to all UMB members
